Note: this is very experimental research code and is not particularly easy to use or documented.

Usage:

1. Edit reordererState.py to make sure to import the proper feature extractor (Base-RNN and Base-GRU models can use the same feature extractors, while the Fragment-RNN model needs its own extractor denoted by the "_path" suffix).

2. Run
